#  ClimaX

ClimaX is a weather app inspired in one of the Angela Yu udemy course apps.
With this app I tried to practice the API managment in swift, building a simple but functionaly app. 


## Usage

In ClimaX you have the basics functionalities of a weather app:
    -   Watch the current weather of any city in the world.
    -   Preview the climates for the next hours.
    -   Know the weather of your current location.


## Installation

To clonning the project, you have to run the following git code into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/HilarioCuervo/ClimaX
```

Finally, you just to doble click at the -ClimaX.xcodeproj- file, and you can enjoy the ClimaX App!
